04. Introduction to [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

install [`pytorch`](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) using `conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch`

error: can import torch from python in the command line but unable to import it within jupyter notebook and got message like
```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'
```
[solution](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/4827#issuecomment-381645288): run `conda list` and check whether jupyter is installed or not. If not, run 
```bash
conda install jupyter
```
Now, open jupyter notebook and run `import torch` .


above doesn't really work, what really work is creating a conda environment, please refer to `setup/environment.yml`, when you use it for the first time, create virtual environment first by running `bash ./setup/setup.sh` from the roor folder. in the future, activate `pytorch` virtual environment every time you need to work on the projects in this course.

2. single layer neural networks
[`torch.sum()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.sum): returns sum of all elements in a tensor

3. Single layer neural networks solution
[torch.mm()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.mm): matrix multiplication
for matrix multiplications, the number of columns in the first tensor must equal to the number of rows in the second column.
- `weights.reshape(a, b)` will return a new tensor with the same data as `weights` with size `(a, b)` sometimes, and sometimes a clone, as in it copies the data to another part of memory.
- `weights.resize_(a, b)` returns the same tensor with a different shape. However, if the new shape results in fewer elements than the original tensor, some elements will be removed from the tensor (but not from memory). If the new shape results in more elements than the original tensor, new elements will be uninitialized in memory. Here I should note that *the underscore at the end of the method denotes that this method is performed **in-place**.* Here is a great forum thread to [read more about in-place operations](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/what-is-in-place-operation/16244) in PyTorch.
- `weights.view(a, b)` will return a new tensor with the same data as `weights` with size `(a, b)`.

usually use `.view()`, but any of the three methods will work for this.

use `tensor.shape` to debug common bugs
